# Text

A simple `Text`. All text should be wrapped in this component for better compatibility with platforms that don't support text outside of tags, such as React Native.

`Text` accepts any component or strings as children.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Text>This is a paragraph.</Text>
  <Text inline>This is an inline text. A span element is rendered instead.</Text>
  <Text fontWeight="bold" color="pink">Styled text</Text>
  <Text>There's a <Button>button</Button> inside this text!</Text>
  <Text fontSize="xlarge">This text is very large.</Text>
</Playground>
